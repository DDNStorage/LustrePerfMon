# Lustre Monitoring System 

*LustrePerfMon* is a monitoring system that can collect system statistics of Lustre (and other systems) for performance monitoring and analysis. It is based on multiple widely used open-source software.

**Note: *LustrePerfMon* is provided as-is and is not part of the official DDN product portfolio.**

This *LustrePerfMon* depends on a specific version of Collectd with Lustre plugins. It can be found at:
    https://github.com/DDNStorage/collectd

## Quick Start

### Building

To build an ISO, do:

1. Edit /etc/esmon_build.conf. Most of the time this file can be left untouched, i.e. empty or even missing.
2. yum install python-dateutil PyYAML -y
3. ./esmon_build

### Installation

To install the *LustrePerfMon* in the cluster, you need to:

1. Install the `esmon*.rpm` included in the ISO
2. Configure `/etc/esmon_install.conf` properly.
3. Run `esmon_install` command.

### Test

To run reguession tests to make sure ESMON works well, do:

1. Build the ISO.
2. Edit /etc/esmon_test.conf. This configuration is more complex than esmon_build.conf as you can imagine.
3. ./esmon_test

## Introduction

### Terminology

- **LustrePerfMon**: Abbreviation for *Lustre Performance Monitoring System*.
- **DDN SFA**: *DDN* *Storage Fusion Architecture* provides the foundation for balanced, high-performance storage. Using highly parallelized storage processing technology, SFA delivers both unprecedented IOPS and massive throughput.
- **DDN EXAScaler**: Software stack developed by DDN to overcome the toughest storage and data management challenges in extreme, data-intensive environments.
- **Installation Server**: The server on which the installation process is triggered.
- **Monitoring Server**: The server on which the database (*Influxdb*) and web server (*Grafana*) of the monitoring system will run.
- **Monitoring** **Agent(s)**: The hosts, from which the monitoring system will collect metrics from. The metrics includes information about CPU, memory, Lustre, SFA storage, and so on. A *collectd* daemon will run on each monitoring client.
- **DDN IME**: DDN’s *Infinite Memory Engine (IME)* is a flash-native, software-defined, storage cache that streamlines application IO, eliminating system bottlenecks.
- **Lustre**: The *Lustre* file system is an open-source, parallel file system  that supports many requirements of leadership class HPC simulation environments.
- **OST**: The *Object Storage Target(OST)* of *Lustre* is the storage target that store the file data objects.
- **OSS**: The *Object Storage Server(OSS)* of *Lustre* is the server that manage the *Object Storage Target*.
- **MDT**: The *Metadata Target(MDT)* of *Lustre* is the storage target that stores the file metadata.
- **MDS**: The *Metadata Servers(MDS)* of *Lustre* is the server that provides metadata services for a file system and manages one or multiple Metadata Target (MDT).

### Collectd plugins of DDN

One of the main components of *LustrePerfMon* is **сollectd**. **collectd** is a daemon, which collects system performance statistics periodically and provides mechanisms to store the values in a variety of ways. *LustrePerfMon* is based on the open-source **collectd**, yet includes more plugins, such as Filedata, Ganglia, Nagios, Stress, Zabbix and so on.

Several additional plugins are added to **collectd** in LustrePerfMon to support various functions.

- **Filedata plugin**: The **Filedata** plugin is able to collect data by reading and parsing a set of files. An XML-formatted definition file is required for the **Filedata** plugin to understand which files to read and how to parse these files. The most common usage of the **Filedata** plugin is to collect metrics through /proc interfaces of a running Lustre system.

- **Ganglia plugin**: The **Ganglia** plugin can send metrics collected by a **collectd** client daemon to Ganglia server.

- **IME plugin**: The **IME** plugin can collect performance information from **DDN IME**. The **IME** plugin shares the similar definition file format and configuration format with the **Filedata** plugin.

- **SSH plugin**: The **SSH** plugin is able to collect metrics by running commands on remote hosts by using SSH connections. The **SSH** plugin is used to collect metrics from DDN SFA Storage. Like the **IME** plugin, the **SSH** plugin shares the similar definition file format and configuration format with the **Filedata** plugin.
-  **Stress plugin**: The **Stress** plugin can push a large amount of metrics to server from **collectd** client in order to benchmark the performance of the collecting system under high pressure.
- **Stress2 plugin**: Enhanced version of **Stress** plugin. The format of pushed metrics can be flexibly configured to simulate different real metrics.
- **Zabbix plugin**: The Zabbix plugin is used to send metrics from **collectd** to **Zabbix** system.

## Installation Requirements

### Installation Server

## Installation Process

### Preparing the Installation Server

1. Copy the LustrePerfMon ISO image file to the Installation Server, for example, to /ISOs/esmon.iso.

2. Mount the LustrePerfMon ISO image on the Installation Server:

   ```shell
   mount -o loop /ISOs/esmon.iso /media
   ```

3. On the Installation Server, back up old LustrePerfMon configuration file, if there is any:

   ```shell
   cp /etc/esmon_install.conf /etc/esmon_install.conf_backup
   ```

4. On the Installation Server, uninstall old LustrePerfMon RPM, if there is any:

   ```shell
   rpm -e esmon
   ```

5.  Install the LustrePerfMon RPM on the Installation Server:

   ```shell
   rpm -ivh /media/RPMS/rhel7/esmon*.rpm
   ```

### Monitoring Server

If firewall is started on the monitoring server, the ports 3000, 4242, 8086, 8088 and 25826 should be opened, otherwise the installation or running of LustrePerfMon might have problem. The 3000 port is for the webb interface of Grafana. The ports 4242, 8086, 8088, 25826 are for the data communication and management of Influxdb, Grafana and Collectd.

### Updating the configuration

After the LustrePerfMon RPM has been installed on the Installation Server, update the configuration file /etc/esmon_install.conf, which includes all the necessary information for installation. Define the following parameters:

- In the section **agents**, specify information about all of the hosts where LustrePerfMon agent packages should be installed and configured:
  - **enable_disk** —This option determines whether to collect disk metrics from this agent. Default value: **false**.
  - **host_id** — This option is the ID of the host. The ID of a host is a unique value to identify the host. Two hosts should not share the same **host_id**.
  -  **ime** —This option determines whether to enable IME metrics collection on this LustrePerfMon agent. Default value: **false**.
  - **infiniband** —This option determines whether to enable Infiniband metrics collection on this LustrePerfMon agent. Default value: **false**.
  - **lustre_mds** — Define whether to enable (**true**) or disable (**false**) metrics collection of Lustre MDS. Default value: **true**.
  - **lustre_oss** — Define whether to enable (**true**) or disable (**false**) metrics collection of Lustre OSS. Default value: **true**.
  -  **sfas** — This list includes the information of DDN SFAs on this LustrePerfMon agent.
    - **controller0_host** — This option is the hostname/IP of the controller 0 of this SFA. Default value: **controller0_host**.
    - **controller****1_host** — This option is the hostname/IP of the controller 1 of this SFA. Default value: **controller1_host**.
    - **Name** —This option is the unique name of this controller. This value will be used as the value of "fqdn" tag for metrics of this SFA. Thus, two SFAs shouldn't have the same **name**.
  
- **agents_reinstall** — Define whether to reinstall (**true**) LustrePerfMon clients or not (**False**). Default value: **true**.

- **collect_interval** — The interval (in seconds) to collect data points on LustrePerfMon clients. Default value: **60**.

- **continuous_query_interval** — The interval of continuous query. The value of **continuous_query_interval \* collect_interval** is the real interval in seconds between two adjacent data points of each continuous query. Usually, in order to down sample the data and reduce performance impact, this value should be larger than "1". Default value: **4**.

- **iso_path** — The path where the LustrePerfMon ISO image is saved. Default value: **/root/esmon.iso**.

- **lustre_default_version** — The default Lustre version to use, if the Lustre RPMs installed on the LustrePerfMon client is not the supported version. The current supported values of the parameter are **es2**, **es3**, **es4** and **error**. If the parameter **error** is configured, an error will be raised when an LustrePerfMon client is using an unsupported Lustre version.

- **lustre_exp_ost** — Define whether to enable (**true**) or disable (**false**) metrics collection of export information of Lustre OST. To avoid a flood of metrics, this parameter is usually disabled in Lustre file systems with a large number of clients. Default value: **false**.

- **lustre_exp_mdt** — Define whether to enable (**true**) or disable (**false**) metrics collection of export information of Lustre MDT. To avoid a flood of metrics, this parameter is usually disabled in Lustre file systems with a large number of clients. Default value: **false**.

- In the section **server**, specify information about all of the hosts where LustrePerfMon server packages should be installed and configured:

  - **drop_database** —If the parameter is set to **true**, the LustrePerfMon database in Influxdb will be dropped. If the parameter is set to **false**, the LustrePerfMon database in Influxdb will be kept as it is. Default value: **false**.

    ---------------------

    **Important:      drop_database** should only be enabled when the data in Influxdb is not needed anymore. 

    -----------
    
  - **erase_influxdb** — If the parameter is enabled (set to **true**), all the data and metadata of Influxdb will be completely erased. By enabling **erase_influxdb**, some corruption problems of Influxdb could be fixed. If the parameter is disabled (set to **False**), the data and metadata of Influxdb will not be completely erased.
  
    ----------------

    **Important:      erase_influxdb** should only be enabled when the data/metadata in Influxdb is not needed anymore. Please double check the influxdb_path option is properly configured before enabling this option.

    ----------------------

  - **host_id** — The unique ID of the host.

  - **influxdb_path** — This option is Influxdb directory path on LustrePerfMon server node. Default value: **/esmon/influxdb**.

    ------------
  
    **Important:**      Please do not put any other files/directries under this directory of LustrePerfMon server node, because, with "erase_influxdb" option enabled, all of the files/directries under that directory will be removed.
  
    ------------------------------
  
  - **reinstall** —This option determines whether to reinstall the LustrePerfMon server. Default value: **true**.

- In the section **ssh_hosts**, specify details necessary to log in to the Monitoring Server and to each Monitoring Agent using SSH connection:

  - **host_id** — The unique ID of the host. Two hosts *should not* share the same **host_id**.
  - **hostname** — The hostname/IP to use when connecting to the host using SSH. "ssh" command will use this hostname/IP to login into the host. If the host is the LustrePerfMon server, this hostname/IP will be used as the server host in the **write_tsdb** plugin of LustrePerfMon agent.
  -  **ssh_identity_file** — The SSH key file used for connecting to the host. If the default SSH identity file works, this option can be set to **None**. Default value: **None**.
  - **local_host** —This option determines whether this host is local host. Default value: **false**.

  --------------

  **Note:   host_id** and **hostname** can be different for a host, because there can be multiple ways to connect to the same host.

  -------------
  

Below is an example of /etc/esmon_install.conf:

```yaml
Example:

agents:
  - enable_disk: false
    host_id: Agent1
    ime: false
    infiniband: false

continuous_query_interval: 4
iso_path: /root/esmon.iso
lustre_default_version: es3
lustre_exp_mdt: false
lustre_exp_ost: false
server:
  drop_database: false
  erase_influxdb: false
  host_id: Server
  influxdb_path: /esmon/influxdb
  reinstall: true
ssh_hosts:
  - host_id: Agent1
    hostname: Agent1
    local_host: false
    ssh_identity_file: None
  - host_id: Agent2
    hostname: Agent2
  - host_id: Server
    hostname: Server
```

### Running installation on the cluster

After the */etc/esmon_install.conf* file has been updated correctly on the Installation Server, run the following command to start the installation on the cluster:

```shell
esmon_install
```

All the logs that are useful for debugging are saved under /var/log/esmon_install directory of the Installation Server.

Apart from installing LustrePerfMon on a fresh system, the command **esmon_install** can also be used for upgrading an existing LustrePerfMon system. The configuration file */etc/esmon_install.conf* should be backed up after installation of LustrePerfMon in case of upgrading in the future.

----------

**Important:**      When upgrading an existing LustrePerfMon system, **erase_influxdb** and **drop_database** should be disabled, unless the data or metadata in Influxdb is not needed anymore.

---------

When installing or upgrading, **esmon_install** will cleanup and install the default LustrePerfMon dashboards of Grafana. Except for the default LustrePerfMon dashboards, **esmon_install** will not change any other existing dashboards of Grafana.

-------------

**Important:**      Before upgrading an existing LustrePerfMon system, all default LustrePerfMon dashboards customized via a Grafana web page should be saved under different names, otherwise the modifications will be overwritten.

------------

### Accessing the Monitoring Web Page

The Grafana service is started on the Monitoring Server automatically. The default HTTP port is 3000. A login web page will be shown through that port (see [Figure 1](#figure-1-grafana-login-web-page) below). The default user and password are both “admin”.

###### Figure 1: Grafana Login Web Page

![Login Dashboard](doc/pic/login.jpg)

------

**Important:**      The host that runs the web browser to access the monitoring web page should have the same time clock and time zone with the servers. Otherwise, the monitoring results might be shown incorrectly.

----------

## Dashboards

From the Home dashboard (see [Figure 2](#figure-2-home-dashboard)) different dashboards can be chosen to view different metrics collected by LustrePerfMon.

###### Figure 2: Home Dashboard

![Home Dashboard](doc/pic/home.jpg)

### Cluster Status Dashboard

The **Cluster Status** dashboard (see [Figure 3](#figure-3-cluster-status-dashboard) below) shows a summarized status of the servers in the cluster. The background color of panels show the servers’ working status:

- If the color of the panel is green, it means the server is under normal condition.

- If the color of the panel is yellow, it means the server is under warning status due to one or more of the following conditions:
  - Idle CPU is less than 20%

  - Load is higher than 5
  - Free memory is less than 1000 MiB
  - Free space of “/” is less than 10 GiB

- If the color of the panel is red, it means the server is under critical status due to one or more of the following conditions:

  - Idle CPU is less than 5% 
  - Load is higher than 10

  - Free space of “/” is less than 1 GiB

  - Free memory is less than 100 MiB

- In each Lustre I/O, if the next page to be written or read in the I/O is not with the next offset, that page is a discontinuous page. There could be multiple discontinuous pages in an I/O. I/Os with less discontinuous pages are more friendly to OSTs, and underlying disk system will obtain much better performance. The **Distribution of Discontinuous Pages in Each Write I/O** panel ([Figure 29](#figure-29-distribution-of-discontinuous-pages-in-each-write-io-panel)) shows the ratio information of the discontinuous pages in each write I/O in the Lustre filesystem. As shown in the figure, the total percentage of discontinuous pages “0_pages” is 100%, which means all pages are continuous.

- The **Distribution of Discontinuous Blocks** panel ([Figure 31](#figure-31-distribution-of-discontinuous-blocks-in-each-write-io-panel)) shows the ratio information of the discontinuous blocks in each write I/O in the Lustre filesystem. In each Lustre read/write I/O, the meaning of discontinuous blocks is similar to discontinuous pages. How many pages a block contains is determined by the underlying filesystem (ldiskfs).If an I/O has discontinuous blocks, there must exist discontinuous pages, but the opposite is not necessarily true. As shown in the figure, the percentage of write discontinuous blocks “0_blocks” in each write I/O is 100%, which means nearly all write I/O are continuous.

- For various reasons (e.g. too many pages to read or write per single I/O), read or write I/O sent by Lustre OSD to the underlying disk system may be split into multiple disk I/Os. The **Distribution of Fragments in Each Write I/O** panel ([Figure 33](#figure-33-distribution-of-fragments-in-each-write-io-panel)) shows the distribution of write I/Os by the number of disk I/Os each write I/O is split into. As shown in the figure, “1_fragments” denotes that I/O is not split. The percentage of “1_fragments” is 100%, which means that none of the write I/O is split and all of them are continuous. “2_fragments” denotes that Lustre write I/O is split into two disk block I/Os, and the percentage in the figure is 0%.

## Stress Testing

In order to check whether the monitoring system works well under high pressure, DDN designed the **collectd-stress2** plugin for stress testing. It is an upgraded version of the **Stress** plugin, which can use a couple of **collectd** clients to simulate tens of thousands of metrics collected from hundreds of servers.

### Installing stress2 RPM on collectd Client

Because the **stress2** plugin generates a large amount of simulated monitoring data and contaminates the database, the plugin *should not* be installed on all clients by default. After the monitoring system has been installed using esmon_install, select a couple of **collectd** clients as testing hosts and install the **stress2** plugins on each of the testing hosts. The RPM collectd-stress2 * .rpm should be located in the ISO directory. To install the RPM, run the following command:

```shell
rpm --ivh collectd-stress2*.rpm
```

### Updating Configuration File of Collectd Client

After **stress2** RPMs have been installed, update the configuration file /etc/collectd.conf and add the following configuration:

- **Thread** —Defines the number of test threads.

- **Metric** — Defines all the attributes of the monitoring target. It can be specified multiple times to simulate different monitoring targets at the same time. It contains the following attributes:

	- **Variable** — Defines the scope of the monitoring target changes and the speed of change, it can be specified multiple times.

		- **Name** — Defines the variable name.

		- **Number** — Defines the maximum range of variable changes.

		- **UpdateInterval** — Defines the time interval between variable changes.

	- **Host**—Defines the host name of the client, usually defined as "$ {key: hostname}", the program automatically sets the current host name. It describes the discriminator of the collection data object together with the following **Plugin**, **PluginInstance**, **Type**, **TypeInstance**. See [Naming Schema](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Naming_schema) for details.

	- **Plugin**—Defines the plugin member in the collectd identifier.

	- **PluginInstance**—Defines the plugininstance member in the collectd identifier.

	- **Type**—The type member of the collectd identifier. For details, see https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Derive.

	- **TypeInstance**—Defines the type instance member in the collectd identifier.

	- **TsdbName**—Defines the name submitted to the database format.

    - **TsdbTags**—Defined the tags submitted to the database format to facilitate the late classification search.

Below is an example of /etc/collectd.conf.

```yaml
Example:

LoadPlugin stress2
<Plugin "stress2">
  Thread 32
  <Metric>
	<Variable>
	    Name "ost_index"
	    Number 10
	    UpdateIterval 0
	</Variable>
	<Variable>
	    Name "job_id"
	    Number 7000
	    UpdateIterval 10
	</Variable>
	  Host "${key:hostname}"
	  Plugin "stress-${variable:ost_index:OST%04x}"
	  PluginInstance "jobstat_${variable:job_id:job%d}"
	  Type "derive"
	  TypeInstance "sum_read_bytes"
	  TsdbName "ost_jobstats_samples"
	  TsdbTags "optype=sum_read_bytes fs_name=stress ost_index=${variable:ost_index:OST%04x} job_id=${variable:job_id:job%d}"
   </Metric>
  <Metric>
	<Variable>
	    Name "mdt_index"
	    Number 10
	    UpdateIterval 0
	</Variable>
	<Variable>
	    Name "md_stats"
	    Number 10
	    UpdateIterval 10
	</Variable>
	  Host "${key:hostname}"
	  Plugin "stress-${variable:mdt_index:MDT%04x}"
	  PluginInstance "md_stats"
	  Type "derive"
	  TypeInstance "open"
	  TsdbName "md_stats"
	  TsdbTags "optype=open fs_name=stress mdt_index=${variable:mdt_index:MDT%04x} mdt_stats_open=${variable:mdt_stats_open:%d}"
   </Metric>
</Plugin>
```

### Start Testing

After modifying the configuration file, restart collectd:

service collectd restart

A message like the following should appear in */var/log/messages*:

server11 collectd[20830]: stress2: time: 1.79244 for 70100 commits with 32 threads, 39108.70099 commits/second

The above information shows that stress2 plugin successfully loaded , and generated a lot of monitoring data. With the above configuration file and following specified hardware environment, the corresponding monitoring bottlenecks were checked.

- **OS: **CentOS7.

- **Memory**: 128GB.

- **CPU:** Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz.

- **Disk:** Samsung SSD 850  2B6Q.

The monitoring client and database server are running on the same host, Influxdb data is stored on SSD with ext4 file system.

**Preconditions:**

- **Collectd Interval:** 60 seconds.

- **Grafana History:** 1 hour.

- **Grafana** **Refresh** **Interval:** 60 seconds.

- **Collectd** **Running** **Time:** more than 1 hour.

**Conclusion:**

- **Grafana keeps on refreshing:** monitor overload.

- **Grafana has idle time:** monitor running well.

In theory, Grafana's refresh time equals the database query time plus the web page load time.

We can query the database to measure the performance of the database query. For example the following is the default query command for LustrePerfMon Grafana **Read Throughput per Job**:
```sql
influx -database esmon_database –execute \

"SELECT "value" FROM "ost_jobstats_samples" WHERE ("optype" = 'sum_read_bytes' AND "fs_name" = 'stress') AND time >= now() - 1h GROUP BY "job_id"" 
```

With the monitoring software running, the above command on the database host can be executed to verify the query time. As shown in [Figure 71](#figure-71number-of-available-ldlm-canceld-request-buffers-panel), the query time of the Influxdb grew linearly during the first hour, because the data points kept on accumulating . But after an hour, the query time became steady, which is also expected behavior.

###### Figure 131：Influxdb Query Time
![Write Latency Samples Panel of SFA Virtual Disk Dashboard](doc/pic/influx_query_time.png)

After verifying the load on the database side, we also need to verify the loading status of Grafana. Log in to Grafana to see **Read Throughput per Job** (see [Figure 72](#figure-72number-of-active-ldlm-callback-requests-panel))

###### Figure 132：Read throughput per Job stress testing
![Write Latency Samples Panel of SFA Virtual Disk Dashboard](doc/pic/read_throughput_per_job_statisics.jpg)


If the page is always refreshing and the page can be loaded within 60 seconds, that means, under the current configuration, the monitoring system can handle the current pressure. Otherwise, the monitoring system can be considered overloaded. In that case, either hardware need to be upgraded or the data collecting/refreshing intervals need to be increased. By continuously adjusting the number of **job_id** in */etc/collectd.conf* and checking the page refreshing latency, the maximum supported metrics can be known under the current hardware configuration. Tests show that if Lustre has 10 OSTs, with above hardware, the monitoring system can support up to 7000 running jobs at the same time without any problem.

## Troubleshooting

The directory */var/log/esmon_install/[installing_date]* on the Installation Server gathers all the logs that is useful for debugging. If a failure happens, some error messages will be written  to the file */var/log/esmon_install/[installing_date]/error.log*. The first error message usually contains the information about the cause of failure.
