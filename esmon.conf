# Configuration file of Exascaler monitoring system
#
# Configuration Guide:
#
# $upgrade:
# Whether to upgrade ESMON packages if there are already installed
#
# $ssh_hosts:
# $ssh_hosts includes the informations of logining to the server hosts using
# SSH connections. $host_id is the unique ID of the host. Two hosts shouldn't
# share a same $host_id. $hostname is the host name to use when connecting to
# the host using SSH. $host_id and $hostname could be different, because there
# could multiple ways to connect to the same host. $ssh_identity_file is the
# SSH key file used when connecting to the host. $ssh_identity_file could be
# omitted if the default SSH identity file works.
#
# $client_hosts:
# $client_hosts includes all of the hosts that ESMON client packages should be
# installed and configured. $lustre_oss defines whether to enable metric
# collection of Lustre OSS. $lustre_mds defines whether to enable metric
# collection of Lustre MDS. $ime defines whether to enable metric collection of
# DDN IME.
#
# server_host:
# $host_id in $server_host is the host ID that ESMON server packages should be
# installed and configured. If $erase_influxdb is true, all of the data and
# metadata of Influxdb will be erased completely. And if $drop_database is tru,
# the database of ESMON in Influxdb will be dropped. $erase_influxdb and
# $drop_database should only be when the data in Influxdb is not needed any
# more. By enabling $erage_influxdb, some corruption problems of Influxdb could
# be fixed.
