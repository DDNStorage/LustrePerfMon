# $ssh_hosts:
# $ssh_hosts includes the informations of logining to the server hosts using
# SSH connections. $host_id is the unique ID of the host. Two hosts shouldn't
# share a same $host_id. $hostname is the host name to use when connecting to
# the host using SSH. $host_id and $hostname could be different, because there
# could multiple ways to connect to the same host. $ssh_identity_file is the
# SSH key file used when connecting to the host. $ssh_identity_file could be
# omitted if the default SSH identity file works.
