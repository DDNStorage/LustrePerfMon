# DDN Exascaler Monitoring System Manual

## Definitions

- **ESMON**: Abbreviation for *DDN Exascaler Monitoring System*.
- **DDN Exascaler**: *DDN Exascaler* is software stack developed by *DDN* to overcome the toughest storage and data management challenges in extreme, data-intensive environments.
- **Installation Server**: The server on which the installation process is triggered.


- **Monitoring Server**: The server on which the database (*Influxdb*) and web server (*Grafana*) of the monitoring system will run.

- **Monitoring Client(s):**  The servers from which the monitor system will collect metrics from. The metrics includes information about CPU, memory, Lustre, SFA storage, etc. A *Collectd* daemon will run on each monitoring client.

- **DDN IME**: *DDNâ€™s Infinite Memory Engine (IME)* is a flash-native, software-defined, storage cache that streamlines application IO, eliminating system bottlenecks.

- **Lustre**: The *Lustre* file system is an open-source, parallel file system that supports many requirements of leadership class HPC simulation environments.

##Introduction

*ESMON* is a monitoring system which can collect system statistics of DDN Exascaler for performance monitoring and analyzing. It is based on multiple widely used open-source software. Some extra plugins and are developed by DDN for enhancemen.

One of the main components of *ESMON* is *Collectd*. *Collectd* is a daemon which collects system performance statistics periodically and provides mechanisms to store the values in a variety of ways. *ESMON* is based on the open-source *Collectd*, yet includes more plugins, such as Lustre, GPFS, Ganglia, Nagios, Stress, Zabbix and so on.

###Collectd plugins of DDN

Several additional plugins are added to *Collectd* in *ESMON* to support various functions.

- **Filedata plugin:** The *Filedata* plugin is able to collect data by reading and parsing a set of files. And definition file with XML format is needed for the *Filedata* plugin to understand which files to read and how to parse these files. The most common usage of *Filedata* plugin is to collect metrics through /proc interfaces of a running *Lustre* system. 
- **Ganglia plugin:** The *Ganglia* plugin can send metrics collected by a *Collectd* client daemon to *Ganglia* server.
- **GPFS plugin:** The *GPFS* plugin can collect performance information through "mmpmon" commands provided by *GPFS*. The *GPFS* plugin shares the same definition file format with *Filedata* plugin. The  configuration format of *GPFS* in *collectd.conf* is also similar with *Filedata* plugin.
- **IME Plugin:** The *IME* plugin can collect performance information from *DDN IME*. Like *GPFS* plugin, the *IME* plugin shares the similar definition file format and configuration format with *Filedata* plugin.
- **SSH plugin:** The *SSH* plugin is able to collect metrics by running commands on remote hosts by using SSH connections. The *SSH* plugin is used to collectd metrics from *DDN SFA* Storage. Like *GPFS* plugin and *IME* plugin, the *IME* plugin shares the similar definition file format and configuration format with *Filedata* plugin.
- **Stress plugin:** The *Stress* plugin can push a large amount of metrics to server from *Collectd* client in order to benchmark the performance of the collecting system under high pressure.
- **Zabbix plugin:** The *Zabbix* plugin is able to send metrics from *Collectd* to *Zabbix* system.

##Installation Requirements

###Installation Server

- OS distribution: CenOS7/RHEL7
- Free disk space: > 500 MB. The *installation server* will save all installation logs to */var/log/esmon_install* directory, which requires some free disk space.
- Network:  The *installation server* be able to start SSH connections to the *monitoring server* and *monitoring clients* without  password prompt
- *ESMON* ISO image :  The *installation server* should posses the *ESMON* ISO image.

###Monitoring Server

- OS distribution: CenOS7/RHEL7
- Free disk space:  > 5G. *Influxdb* will be running on this server. More disk space is required to keep more data into *Influxdb* 
- Network: SSHD should be running on the *monitoring server* and it should be able to be connected by *installation server* without prompting for password.

###Monitoring Client

- OS distribution: CenOS7/RHEL7 or CentOS6/RHEL6
- Free disk space:  > 200M. The *installation server* will save necessary RPMs in directory */var/log/esmon_install*, which requires some free disk space.
- Network: SSHD should be running on the *monitoring client* and it should be able to be connected by *installation server* without prompting for password.

##Installation Process

###1. Prepare the *Installation Server*

1. Grab the *ESMON* ISO image file to the *installation server*, for example: /ISOs/esmon.iso.

2. Mount the *ESMON* ISO image:

      ```shell
      # mount -o loop /ISOs/esmon.iso /media
      ```

3. Start the install script:

      ```shell
      # cd /media && sh ./installesmon.sh
      ```

###2. Update the Configuration File

The configuration file */etc/esmon_install.conf* includes all the necessary information for installation. Following is an example:

```yaml
iso_path: /work/ISOs/esmon.iso             # ISO path to ESMON
ssh_hosts:                                 # Array of hosts
  - host_id: Monitoring-Server             # ID of this SSH host
    hostname: Monitoring-Server            # The host name
    ssh_identity_file: /root/.ssh/id_rsa   # The SSH key to connect to the host
  - host_id: Monitoring-Client1
    hostname: Monitoring-Client1
    ssh_identity_file: /root/.ssh/id_rsa
  - host_id: Monitoring-Client2
    hostname: Monitoring-Client2
    ssh_identity_file: /root/.ssh/id_rsa
client_hosts:                              # Array of client hosts of ESMON
  - host_id: Monitoring-Client1            # Host ID
    lustre_oss: true                       # Whether enable Lustre OSS monitoring
    lustre_mds: true                       # Whether enable Lustre MDS monitoring
    ime: false                             # Whether enable IME monitoring
  - host_id: Monitoring-Client2
    lustre_oss: false
    lustre_mds: true
    ime: false 
server_host:
    host_id: Monitoring-Server # Server host ID of ESMON
    drop_database: true        # Whether to drop existing ESMON database in Influxdb
    erase_influxdb: true       # Whether to erase all data/metadata of Influxdb
```

**iso_path** is the path where *ESMON* ISO image is saved

**ssh_hosts** includes the information of how to login to the hosts using SSH connections. **host_id** is the unique ID of the host. Two hosts shouldn't share a same **host_id**. **hostname** is the host name to use when connecting to the host using SSH. **host_id** and **hostname** could be different for a host, because there could multiple ways to connect to the same host. **ssh_identity_file** is the SSH key file used when connecting to the host. **ssh_identity_file** could be omitted if the default SSH identity file works. All the monitoring server* and *monitoring client*s should be included in the **ssh_hosts**.

**client_hosts** includes all of the hosts that *ESMON* client packages should be installed and configured. **lustre_oss ** defines whether to enable metric collection of Lustre OSS. **lustre_mds** defines whether to enable metric collection of Lustre MDS. **ime** defines whether to enable metric collection of *DDN IME*.

**host_id** in **server_host** is the host ID that *ESMON* server packages should be installed and configured. If **erase_influxdb** is true, all of the data and metadata of *Influxdb* will be erased completely. And if **drop_database** is true, the database of ESMON in *Influxdb* will be dropped. **erase_influxdb** and
**drop_database** should only be when the data in *Influxdb* is not needed any more. By enabling **erage_influxdb**, some corruption problems of *Influxdb* could be fixed.

###3. Start the Installation on the Cluster

After the */etc/esmon_install.conf* file has been updated correctly on the *installation server*, following command could be run to start the installation on the cluster:

```shell
# esmon_install
```

All the logs which are useful for debugging are saved under */var/log/esmon_install* directory of the *installation server*.

###4. Access the Monitoring Web Page

The *Grafana* service is started on the *monitoring server* automatically. The default HTTP port is 3000An login web page will been shown through that port.  The default user and password are both "admin".

## Troubleshooting

*/var/log/esmon_install/[installing_date]* directory on the *installation server* gathers all the logs that is useful for debugging. If a failure happens, some error messages will be printed to file */var/log/esmon_install/[installing_date]/error.log*. The first error message usually contains the information about the cause of failure.
