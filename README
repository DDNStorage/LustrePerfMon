LustrePerfMon (ESMON) is a Lustre performance monitoring tool.

For more documentation, please check:
    /doc

This monitoring tool depends on a specific version of Collectd with
Lustre plugins. It can be found at:
    https://github.com/DDNStorage/collectd

To build an ISO, do:
    1. Edit /etc/esmon_build.conf. Most of the time this file can be left untouched, i.e. empty or even missing.
    2. yum install python-dateutil PyYAML -y
    3. ./esmon_build

To run reguession tests to make sure ESMON works well, do:
    1. Build the ISO.
    2. Edit /etc/esmon_test.conf. This configuration is more complex than esmon_build.conf as you can imagine.
    3. ./esmon_test
